      "message": "the *library* part is transitive: if you don\u0027t explicitly do librobinhood or liblustre calls in rbh-find-lustre.c, but rbh_lfind uses these and pulls liblustre then you\u0027ll get liblustre from it.\nIf however you use thse directly in the .c here, you don\u0027t get the headers or direct-level linking unless you explicitly request it. perhaps including robinhood.h isn\u0027t needed at all? I didn\u0027t check, nor did I check if librbhfind/liblustre are actually needed here... so in that sense this patch is probably no good, I was in a hurry\n\n(with that said, I don\u0027t really care - feel free to edit your earlier patch and we\u0027ll abandon this, or we can just get this in (eventually fixed) later if that\u0027s simpler)",
