While I do agree that the dependency to Lustre may not be required, that would mean keeping the same enum of our side and maintaining it.\n\nAlso, if there are other attributes that use Lustre specific symbols (for instance the fid with its macro for printing or lengths), we will still require that include.\n\nSo I\u0027m not sure what\u0027s the correct solution is.",
