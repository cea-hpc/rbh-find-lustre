      "message": "The idea here was to allow the user to query a list of OSTs in one predicate.\n\nFor example, \"-ost [1-7,10-20]\" would match any file which has at least one stripe in OSTs 1 through 7 or 10 through 20. Then if the user wants to specify intersections of range sets, \"-ost ... -ost ...\" will do the trick.\n\nUnless there is a bug in my implementation, that\u0027s what this filter_or and left_filter are supposed to do.",
